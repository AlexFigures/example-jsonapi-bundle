# Production torture results

Generated from complete JUnit and scenario HTTP metrics on bundle `96a1530f3155ddf001b7d1e48fd33e375c382d85`.

- HTTP test outcome PASS: 62
- PASS: 57
- BUNDLE_GAP: 0
- APPLICATION_POLICY: 4
- INFRASTRUCTURE_LIMIT: 1
- UNEXPECTED_FAILURE: 0
- SKIPPED: 0

Wall times are observations, not CI thresholds. Memory is the PHP process peak since request start; baseline includes loaded classes. Rows fetched measures DBAL fetches, not exact ORM hydration. Routing records actual physical database names. Dataset counts exclude the extra BIGINT row.

## Bundle gap inventory

Resolved markers are removed; regression assertions and historical test references remain. Failure details and physical connection/transaction metrics are in `performance-results.json`.

### PERFORMANCE-NPLUS1 — RESOLVED_ON_TESTED_REVISION

PERFORMANCE_GAP · P1 · 0 failing cases.

Expected: Bounded page 5/20 query growth and preserved plain/include/related absolute query budgets.

Bundle subsystem: Doctrine reads and tenant-safe query-plan forwarding.

Current interpretation: All six fixed release scenarios pass in the complete Torture run after explicit tenant-safe query-plan forwarding. Prior page 5/20 counts were constant; the excess was fallback overhead, not proven linear N+1. Public capability stability remains a design decision.

### SCALABILITY-FILTER-BUDGET — RESOLVED_ON_TESTED_REVISION

SCALABILITY_GAP · P1 · 0 failing cases.

Expected: Reject excessive filter trees and operand lists before SQL.

Bundle subsystem: Criteria complexity enforcement.

### SCALABILITY-JOIN-PAGINATION — RESOLVED_ON_TESTED_REVISION

SCALABILITY_GAP · P1 · 0 failing cases.

Expected: Paginate distinct roots across multiple to-many joins without omissions.

Bundle subsystem: Doctrine collection paginator.

- `App\Tests\Torture\Extreme\PaginationUnderJoinsTest::testCartesianJoinsPaginateDistinctRoots`
- `App\Tests\Torture\Extreme\QueryAmplificationTest::testReasonableBooleanAndRelationshipFilterWorks`

### SCALABILITY-INCLUDE-AMPLIFICATION — RESOLVED_ON_TESTED_REVISION

SCALABILITY_GAP · P1 · 0 failing cases.

Expected: Stop include traversal at the cap before mass hydration.

Bundle subsystem: Include traversal and limits.

- `App\Tests\Torture\Performance\HighCardinalityTest::testDenseIncludeIsRejectedBeforeMassHydration`

### ARCHITECTURE-COMPOSITE-ID — RESOLVED_ON_TESTED_REVISION

ARCHITECTURE_GAP · P1 · 0 failing cases.

Expected: Reject unsupported composite identifiers during resource/route discovery with a diagnostic.

Bundle subsystem: Doctrine metadata discovery.

- `App\Tests\Torture\Extreme\CompositeDiscoveryTest::testUnsupportedCompositeIdIsRejectedDuringRouteDiscovery`

### CONSISTENCY-ETAG — RESOLVED_ON_TESTED_REVISION

CONSISTENCY_GAP · P0 · 0 failing cases.

Expected: Two writers with the same validator produce one success and one 412 without loser mutation.

Bundle subsystem: Write preconditions and optimistic concurrency.

- `App\Tests\Torture\Chaos\ConsistencyAndFailureTest::testConcurrentIfMatchAllowsOneWriterOnly`

### CONSISTENCY-UNIQUE-RACE — RESOLVED_ON_TESTED_REVISION

CONSISTENCY_GAP · P0 · 0 failing cases.

Expected: Unique create race yields 201 and JSON:API 409, with exactly one row.

Bundle subsystem: Doctrine constraint error translation.

- `App\Tests\Torture\Chaos\ConsistencyAndFailureTest::testConcurrentUniqueCreateHasOneConflictAndOneRow`

### TRANSACTION-BOUNDARY — RESOLVED_ON_TESTED_REVISION

TRANSACTION_BOUNDARY · P0 · 0 failing cases.

Expected: Reject Atomic batches spanning independent managers/shards before mutation.

Bundle subsystem: Atomic transaction boundary discovery.

- `App\Tests\Torture\Chaos\ConsistencyAndFailureTest::testCrossManagerAtomicRejectedBeforeFirstMutation`
- `App\Tests\Torture\Chaos\TransactionFailureTest::testCrossShardAtomicIsRejectedByBundleBeforeMutation`

### TRANSACTION-SECOND-COMMIT — RESOLVED_ON_TESTED_REVISION

TRANSACTION_BOUNDARY · P0 · 0 failing cases.

Expected: A single-connection PostgreSQL Atomic batch commits only PostgreSQL, succeeds even when an unused MySQL commit would fail, and persists its final state.

Bundle subsystem: Transaction runner manager enlistment.

Current interpretation: The scoped transaction provider does not enlist the unrelated MySQL connection.

Cross-connection Atomic must be rejected before mutation; same-connection Atomic must preserve all-or-nothing rollback. No distributed transaction is required.
